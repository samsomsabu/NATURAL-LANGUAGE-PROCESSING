    "\n",
    "Synsets help us in finding synonyms, word relevancy, etc. It is alos used for sentiment analysis, text summrizations, etc.\n",

    "What are we doing in the following methods is very simple. After getting the input from the user, we are making a synset for the word, and cross-referencing it with the Wordnet dictionaries, and if we found relevant words, expressions, etc. we are giving them as the output to the user.\n",

    "Moreover this is a menu-driven program, which mean the user will be able to choose what he wants from the program. He has to enter a choice and the program will perform operations according to the user choice."
